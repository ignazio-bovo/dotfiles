#+title: critique of market socialism

Heyek argued that market socialists were preoccupied with a static notion of equilibrium where
all relevant economic knowledge was given, known and frozen. Thus there is no static, fixed
equilibrium: first due to human error which leads to opportunities for re-allocating resources
through the discovery of mistakes. The second is that market conditions are constantly evolving, which
makes prior equilibrium conditions irrelevant. Even if some stable equilibrium were obtained, it
wolud be fleeting as conditions changed.
The  problems  inherent  with  market  socialism,  according  to  Hayek,  
were not a matter of placing smarter people in charge or in developing new 
computational techniques to gather more information. Instead, the issue was 
that the economic knowledge necessary for coordination is dispersed, tacit, 
and emergent. It would encounter hard times for example with equilibrium shifting
discoveries such as innovation in production.
