#+title: internal coordination theory

In digital economy, the economic forces of demand versus supply are generalized into forces of internal coordination
versus price coordination. Supply and demand pertain only to price coordination, while entrepreneurship/self-organization
(which falls outside neo-classical price theory) pertain to internal coordination.
Internal coordination is separate from the forces of supply and demand, and is what equilibrates or regulates
supply and demand.
Thus, it is what motivates natural self-correction and self-governance by market participants
themselves from within the market.
The economic goods produced by a materials economy are material goods, while the economic goods produced
by digital economy are focal point goods. Focal points are the more and less optimal solution to
coordination problems in the absence of direct communication. This means that communication must
be largely tacit or implicit.
