#+title: prisoner dilemma
Two completely [[id:69d75332-8c9f-40f8-9565-14fdf5df153d][rational]] individuals A, B (criminals) are arrested and imprisoned. Each criminal is in
solitary confinement with no means of communicating with one another. Prosecutor offer each prisoner
a bargain: betray the other prisoner by testifying or remain silent, payoff matrix (negative numbers
are years served in prison):

|           | B silent | B betrays |
|-----------+----------+-----------|
| A silent  | -1, -1   | -3, 0     |
|-----------+----------+-----------|
| A betrays | 0, -3    | -2, -2    |


Solution:
- suppose A stays silent: then B should prefer betraying
- suppose A betrays: then B should prefer betraying

Analogous reasoning holds with B instead of A. So each player is better off betraying each other,
which thus is an [[id:e0de9e2b-bf64-4f27-8586-acc340eb58af][nash equilibrium]] for the game
