#+title: marginal theory of value

Marginal theory of value asserts that value is not based on the amount of labour expendend (like
in the [[id:1e40fef0-57f3-4a6d-bb8b-976c324203cd][labour theory of value]]) but rather reflects how useful/desired people perceive the commodity
to be in satisfying their ends. This theory explains the water/diamond paradox
