Pool based lending smart contract, compose of different lending pools.
* Lending Pool
At the heart of a lending pool there is a the concept of *reserve*, every pool holds reserves in
multiple currencies, with the total amount in ETH defined as total liquidity. A reserve accepts
*deposits* from lenders. Borrowers can *borrow* this fund provided that they lock a greater value
as *collateral*. every reserve has a specific *LTV* (loan to value) calculated as the weighthed
average of differnt LTVs of the currencies composing the collateral, where the weight for each LTV
is the equivalent amount of the collateral in ETH.
Every borrow can be opened with a stable or variable rate.
*Liquidation*
In case of price fluctuations, a borrow position might be *liquidated*, this liquidation event is
triggered when the value of the collateral drops below a threshold L_Q. Reaching this ratio channels
a liquidation bonus, which incentivizes liquidators to buy thecollateral at a discounted price.
Every reserve has a specific L_Q, calculated as the the weighted average of the liquidation threshold
of the underlying assets.
At each point in time a borrow position is characterized by a health factor:

H = collateral / (borrowedAmount + fees)

when H < 1 a loan is undercollateralized and can be liquidated
