Olympus is solving the problem of creating a new
currency through internal coordination between different
stakeholders within the protocol, with no policies enforced
by a central entity. It does so by solving an instance of
the [[id:23b297a9-203e-4816-89f7-4da05b029b81][iterated prisoner dilemma]]. [[id:46094152-a461-48ce-a976-8e932458b6f2][tft]] provides the best solution to the game.
Given that each player A,B plays TFT it remains to promote cooperation for
A,B in the first round, i.e. a[1] = b[1] = COOPERATE
