#+title: iterated prisoner dilemma

The iterated [[id:05525bce-146f-42ea-9984-65cff20d5968][prisoner dilemma]] repeats the prisoner dilemma game over and over again. In this setting
the best possible outcomes over the course of the whole series of game occur when both players cooperate
continuously.
To sum it up the best strategy is: on the first move cooperate. Then play whichever strategy the
opponent played in the previous round (TIT-FOR-TAT TFT strategy). If the opponent betrays in the first
round then TFT would defect in the second. Defection will be met with defection. It also pays
to cooperate with TFT since it will cooperate in return. Denote A,B the players as above then
a[n], b[n] are the action that resp A, B play at round n. if A plays TFT then:
- TFT: a[1] = COOPERATE (i.e. silence), a[n] = b[n-1] for n > 1
