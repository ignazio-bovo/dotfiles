   How can I make myself more attractive to them?

   can I get their attention?
3. Develop successful self presentation and interactions: Learn to flirt? Develop engaging conversations?
4.  Build rapport and touching: Develop deeper conversation, pay attention to the romantic aspects of your
   time together. Once you are somewhat sure that she likes you you can try to kiss / escalate touch

   to get or weather to prompt greater investment into a partner.
