#+title: Defi

Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been one of the most impactful and succesful weaves of blockchain based
innovation. Defi is an umbrella term for a series of projects:
Early Defi projects such as [[id:0d71e13b-f6b0-440b-aabb-f1ea4414371a][uniswap]], Aave, MakerDAO, Bancor, Compound have build a solid bedrock
for the developing DeFi economy, introducing composable money LEGOs into the ecosystem.
In order to solve the [[id:d1c3fee4-bb27-488d-bc31-bf73abb7c57b][liquidity problem]] yield farms have been introduced. This provides
enough economic incentives for third parties to provide boostrapping liquidity for DeFi projects
however it does not provide long term guarantees.
The current solution to this problem is POL (Protocol Owned Liquidity) introduced by the [[id:30607b66-ca55-48c3-ab0d-f0a807275f6d][olympusDAO]]
